Hello, my name is Ana! 

I'm a research manager at [eduLab21, a research laboratory at Ayrton Senna Institute](https://institutoayrtonsenna.org.br/). I work designing studies and analyzing data with an awesome group of researchers in the fields of Psychology and Education. I am a experienced researcher in the area of quantitative methods, statistical modelling and survey development. I deliver workshops and presentations on psychometrics and statistical analyses using the R programming language for different levels of expertise. Thus, I enjoy researching about human behavior and analyzing data, but I also enjoy talking about it and discussing new ideas in different communities, such as R-ladies [material available here](https://github.com/anacarlac/2023-Rotinas-em-R---R-ladies).

### What are my interests at the moment?
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub to be a page where I share all the cool stuff that I enjoy talking and researching about it. Also, I am researching about individual differences constructs, such as socioemotional skills and their benefits, and how to build reliable and valid instruments to measure them!

### Previous projects I have worked on:
+ Shiny app about gender data and human rights in Brazil: [available here](https://acrispim.shinyapps.io/appCMIG/)
+ Socioemotional trajectories during the pandemic: First findings from the Sobral Longitudinal Study [available here](https://institutoayrtonsenna.org.br/app/uploads/2024/01/Socioemotional_trajectories_during_the_pandemic_Instituto-Ayrton-Senna.pdf)
+ Socioemotional skills are for life: the relationship between socioemotional development and school performance, learning strategies, well-being, mental health, academic self-esteem, violence, bullying and school belonging [available here](https://institutoayrtonsenna.org.br/app/uploads/2024/01/Ebook_socioemotional_skills_are_for_life_Instituto-Ayrton-Senna.pdf)


### My background... 
ðŸ“š I hold a MSc degree in Psychological Assessment from Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (Brazil) and a PhD in Psychology (Psychometrics) earned at the University of Kent (UK). Following the completion of my PhD, I assumed the role of a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Statistical Modeling applied to Human Behavior at the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) from 2018 to 2019.

âš¡ Fun fact: Aside from researching and analyzing data, I love travelling, reading fiction and non-fiction and exploring all kinds of food. You can find more about these in my instagram account: @anacrispim.
